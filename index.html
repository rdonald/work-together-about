                                I've been developing software since I was a teenager and am excited to be graduating.
                                In addition to writing software I love working with my hands building things, as well as anything outdoors. I love camping, hiking and rock climbing.
                                I have worked professionally as a developer for four years, first as an intern with a professional development company and then with a security company as a junior developer.
                                My experience at these companies helped me learn essential development skills and how to coordinate with a team. <br> <br>

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5 mb-lg-0">Hi, my name is Grayson. <br><br>
                                I was originally an Electrical Engineering student but saw the light and changed majors. <br> <br>
                                
                                When I'm not doing computer science, I play guitar, listen to music, and watch a lot of movies.
                                Since I've lived in Utah my whole life I've also gone on many hikes, repelled down some cliffs, and mountain biked up a few mountains. <br><br>
                                
                                When I am doing computer science, I have worked on a few projects both professionally and as a hobby. <br><br>
                                
                                I built a game with a few friends that was released on IOS and Android called The Green Reaper.
                                I learned how to take a project from an idea to an actual working application available on app stores.
                                Working with my friends who didn't do computer science was also fun, because I got to turn their work into the game we made together. <br><br>
                                
                                I intern shipped at Ostrich Cyber Risk last year and worked on their website doing frontend and backend work.
                                During this internship, I learned about how to work as a professional engineer and how to collaborate with engineers who have been working in computer science for decades.
                                This summer I was hired as a junior developer working on the same project, but this time taking on much larger projects. <br><br>

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5 mb-lg-0">Hi, I’m Max Failla, a soon-to-be graduate from the University of Utah. 
                                Ever since I began programming in high school, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in software development. 
                                My interests include REST APIs, Web Applications, Databases, Networking, High Performance/Parallel Computing, and Computer Security. <br><br>
                                I have been primarily responsible for the backend and backend architecture of Work Together, as most of my skills and interests line up 
                                with backend work. I love working closely with a team to solve software problems, which has made building Work Together a very fulfilling 
                                experience for me. When I’m not writing code, you can find me at the ski areas, on the mountain bike trails, or anywhere else outdoors. <br><br>

                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5 mb-lg-0">Hey, I'm Rory Donald! I'm going to be graduating in Fall 2023 from the University of Utah and 
                                I've had several years of experiance in software engineering outside of college. My first two summer internships were at National Oilwell Varco
                                where I worked as a full stack software engineer developing an application to monitor offshore rig equipment such as blow-out preventors. My last two
                                internships were at a company called MasterControl where I helped develop medical manufacturing software that companies such as Pfizer and Thermo Fisher Scientific
                                utilize. <br><br>

                                My interests in computer science lay mostly in the application realm which involve creating database systems, user interface development, building APIs, and pretty much
                                anything else that is needed to run web applications. Outside of computer science I love to backpack, hike, and play golf (I'm not very good at golf).<br><br>

                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5 mb-lg-0">Users will begin by creating an account and logging in to the application. 
                                    While not required, it is recommended to edit your profile by clicking the profile section of the navigation bar. By clicking the edit button, 
                                    the user can change the fields to reflect who they are. These parameters are global for all classes and apply to both a professor and a student users. <br><br>

                                    Users will also be able to chat with any combination of students in their classes. To begin chatting, click the chat section of the navigation bar. 
                                    Both professors and students use the same tool. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Clicking on create conversation allows the user to create a new conversation with as many users as they 
                                    would like to invite. Clicking on already created conversations will allow you to send new messages. Chats are able to be re-named, and deleted at will 
                                    by any user. When a chat is deleted the current user leaves the chat, but the remaining participants will still be able to use the conversation.

                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5 mb-lg-0">Users that are students and have already created an account can navigate into a project and will be presented with 
                                    a questionnaire of relevant fields that students find the most important. Once the questionnaire is submitted this will create an advertisement card for themselves 
                                    for the rest of the class to see. The advertisement card will be a combination of both answers to the questionnaire and their profile page. <br><br>

                                    Once they are on the group search page a student can filter for specific fields at the top of the page, additionally they can enter into an alternative group search 
                                    view where they can swipe through classmate cards to find suitable teammates. If a user finds a suitable teammate they can either swipe right on the card to invite 
                                    them to their team or return to the group search page and click on their card and press the invite to team button. <br><br>
                                    
                                    To accept an invitation navigate to the notifications page and click on the notification and accept or reject. Once accepted if the user returns to the group search page 
                                    they will see themself on a team and are automatically put into a team group chat on the chatting page. <br><br>
                                    
                                    If a student is in a project that has completed the group search phase they will now be in the project management phase where professors will assign active milestones to 
                                    which the team has to work towards completing. The team can accomplish this by creating tasks and allocating them out amongst themselves. <br><br>
